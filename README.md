# VoxelHap

VoxelHap is an open-source toolkit, aiming to support VR researchers and developers in constructing highly functional proxy objects providing tactile and kinesthetic haptic feedback. It consits of Voxels and Plates: (1) Voxels are blocks with special functionalities that form the core of each physical proxy, (2) Plates increase a proxy's haptic resolution, such as its shape, texture or weight. Beyond providing physical capabilities to realize haptic sensations, VoxelHap utilizes VR illusion techniques to expand its haptic resolution.

## Communication

The Voxels communicate using a Master/Slave architecure. Master (Wemos D1 mini) is connected to a host maschine running Unity3D via serial port. BaseVoxels (slaves) communicate to the master wirelessly using PainlessMesh.

The firmware folder contains the arduino files. Master.ino should be uploaded onto the master (Wemos D1 mini), and Slave_VoxelHap_Cubes.ino onto the BaseVoxels.

## Dependencies 

(1) Voxels have a capcitive touch sensor MPR121. Download Adafruit_MPR121 libray from Arduino IDE. -> https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mpr121-12-key-capacitive-touch-sensor-breakout-tutorial/wiring

(2) Voxels need FastLED library to manage LEDs on board. Download FastLED library from Arduino IDE. -> https://fastled.io/

(3) Voxels cubes also need ArduinoJson library to send JSON file to the master. Download ArduinoJson library from Arduino IDE. -> https://arduinojson.org/

(4) For master - slave communication between Voxels and the master Wemos D1 we use painlessmesh library. Download Painlessmesh library from Arduino IDE, specifically namedmesh example. -> https://gitlab.com/painlessMesh/painlessMesh/-/tree/develop/examples/namedMesh?ref_type=heads

(5) For Unity- Master communication establish Serial communication and import the unity package (with .Net4.x frame work in player settings).
